            <h1>Residents Association</h1>
            
            <p>The aims of the Association are to provide a forum for residents and owners to share information, advice and ideas, including the organisation of social events; and representation for the expression of the collective opinions and wishes of residents and owners to those responsible for estate management and provision of services on matters affecting estate management and amenity at Compass Point and services provided or needed there, so as to keep a high standard of care and maintenance of the common parts, an excellent quality of residential environment, both at good value for money, together with the promotion of good, neighbourly relations within Compass Point and between its residents and the wider community.  The Association runs a Facebook page (under Compass Point E14 Residents) to give updates and allow residents to discuss current issues.  </p>

            <p>Membership of the Association shall be open to all residents. </p>
